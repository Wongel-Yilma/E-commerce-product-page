- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://strong-marzipan-c78a04.netlify.app/)

## My process

- Write the HTML code that would make it easy for manipulation in css and JavaScript. ( Desktop design first)
- Include HTML elements to be generated (It helps better to build them first before manipulating them later on.)
- Style the whole document with css.
- Include all the hover states.
- Select all the DOM elements in Javascript.
- Create a class for the cart and the whole app.
- Embed them with necessary methods to manuipulate data (Rendering the cart, Displaying messages, Delete a cart item...)
- Build the page with creating states in the app class.
- Include media queries to account for Mobile users.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
